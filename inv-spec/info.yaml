  **[inventaire.io](https://inventaire.io) HTTP API documentation**

  **Documentation status**: incomplete / partially out-dated (we need to find a better setup to keep it in sync with [The Truth](https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire/blob/master/server/controllers/routes.js))

  **API stability**: variably stable.

  Please let us know which endpoints you are relying on, and which need to get up the documentation priority list, by letting a message in [the dedicated issue](https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire/issues/29) (or, alternatively, in the [communication channel](https://wiki.inventaire.io/wiki/Communication-channels) of your choice), so that we have a clue of how noisy a breaking change has to be, ideally knowing namingly who should be noticed.

  Beside this documentation, diving into the code is always an option: everything starts in the [router](https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire/blob/master/server/controllers/routes.coffee), and is then delegated to the [controllers](https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire/tree/master/server/controllers).

  Then, feel welcome to [improve this documentation](https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire-api/tree/main/inv-spec)!
